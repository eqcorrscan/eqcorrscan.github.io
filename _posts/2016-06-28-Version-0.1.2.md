{% include JB/setup %}

We have release version 0.1.2, there should be very few changes to the API,
and we have not introduced many new features, however we now have tests
for every function (although this only tests 73% of the code-base due to missing
edge-cases).

Details on the updates can be found on the
[github releases](https://github.com/calum-chamberlain/EQcorrscan/releases) page.
