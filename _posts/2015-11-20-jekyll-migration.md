We have migrated our front-page to a jekyll page, rather than directing you
straight to our API docs (which can now be found
[here](http://eqcorrscan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)).  Hopefully
this page will end up being a place for the developers to update you on
EQcorrscan's progress, what we aim to do, and mostly more textual content
than the real API docs.

You can always find the code on github however:
