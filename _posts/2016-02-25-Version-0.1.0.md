We have updated from the 0.0.x line to 0.1.x releases, this is to signify the
changes in Sfile_utils. Unfortunately there are some bugs in writing S-files
which we are ironing out for 0.1.1, if you find that these bugs effect you
then install the develop branch.  Mostly they are fixed, we are just implimenting
more tests.  Reading things in to EQcorrscan is fine.

Enjoy!
